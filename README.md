### Hi there 👋
My name is Cristobal, and I am a Full Stack developer from Venezuela. I am keen on building experiences from the ground up by being a part of every aspect of a product, especially at the intersection where tech, design, and business meet.

🚀 Currently working on Plantopi, an app to automatically irrigate your plants\

🌱 Currently learning [threejs-journey](https://threejs-journey.xyz) from [@brunosimon](https://github.com/brunosimon), [epic-react](https://epicreact.dev) from [@kentcdodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds), and microcontrollers programming in C++\

🐶 Animal lover and protector ♥️\

😎 In my free time I enjoy kitesurfing, snowboarding, overlanding, travelling, and yoga\

🧐 Fun fact: In a past life, I was an exec in the maritime industry. By the cusp of my career, I was managing a team of over 120 people however, my heart was somewhere else. I was born with the need to create and, although my job was fulfilling in many ways, creating wasn't at the core of it
