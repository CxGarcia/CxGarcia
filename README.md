### Hi there 👋
My name is Cristobal, and I am a full stack developer from Venezuela. 

I have a passion for building experiences from the ground up and being a part of every aspect of a product, especially at the intersection where tech, design, and marketing meet. This junction is where I can add the most value since I know the tools to translate business requirements into software that empowers users.
