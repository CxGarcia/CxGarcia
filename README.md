### Hi there 👋
My name is Cristobal and I am a Full Stack developer from Venezuela. I am keen on building experiences from the ground up and being present at every point of the product including the tech, design, and commercial aspects.

🚀 I’m currently working on Plantopi, an app to automatically irrigate your plants\
\
🌱 I’m currently learning Three.js, 3D animations, and microcontrollers programming in C++\
\
🐶 I'm an animal lover and protector ♥️\
\
😎 In my free time I enjoy kitesurfing, snowboarding, overlanding, travelling, and yoga\
\
🧐 Fun fact: In a past life, I was an exec in the maritime industry. By the cusp of my career, I was managing a team of over 120 people however, my heart was somewhere else. I was born with the need to create and, although my job was fulfilling in many ways, creating wasn't at the core of it
